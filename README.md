# AzureArcSQL
This repository contains videos you can use to go through a DEMO situation to show the value of Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server.
The content was made to help presenting with a more technical perspective where you can speak during video play. 

You can follow the videos as you need. Here you have an order suggestion to tell the story.

1. SQL Onboarding Process

    Shows how to onboard a SQL Server from the Arc SQL Server Instances adding the server and executing the Powershell script there to be recognized in Arc.
  
1. Metadata captured

    You can highlight that ONLY metadata is being capture after onboarding process.
  
    Explain you can see Versions, Editions, Server Names. All as inventory information.
  
    Show that you can go deeper on database information, status and creation or restore time.
  
    Go deeper on a particular database and explain that DBAs are closer to those configurations. The first block is very important for performance, the next highlighted will also help for governance and inventory of the SQL farm.

    In the next video you will see how this information could get summarized.
  
1. Reporting with Dashboards
  
    There is the posibility to work on Azure Dashboards to customize reports with gathered information.
  
    Show how can custom visuals be built to control relevant details and point out specific topics you want to highlight.


1. Best Practices Assessment

     First step is to execute the request for the SQL Assessment. You can show how it is done (00:32).

     While making the request for the SQL Assessment, tell it triggers the execution, collects the information and it saves the results in few minutes.

     After it finishes it generates a complete report. Show in parts the next video (01:35). The first line of sight is the summary of what Issues need to be reviewed and which category those belong.

     It scrolls down where you can name some of the important topics for the Assessment (i.e Performance, Integrity, Backups, Security, Configurations).

     Do the same for the second part, naming some of the items while it scrolls down (i.e There are recommendations for Configurations, Backups best practices, Index usage and Maintenance).

     Tell if there is something unknown or not clear, there is the posibility to choose from the list, click on any item and get a more detailed description and a url reference to official docs if needed.
